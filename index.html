    <h2> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?</h2>

    <b>CLIMATE + CHANGE = CLIMATE CHANGE:</b>
    <p>
    Climate is the weather conditions occurinf in an area in general or over a long period of time.
    For example, Many people love to go to Florida for Spring break because it has a tropical climate meaning that the
    weather is warm during the Spring season.
    </p>
    <p>
    CHANGE: the act or instance of making of becoming different. For example, when you go through puberty your body
    changes as you become a young adult.
    </p>

    <p>
    You put these two words together and <b> BAM!</b> you get <em> CLIMATE CHANGE.</em>
    </p>

    Climate Change is exactly what it sounds like, it's when there is a big difference in normal climate patterns
    over a long time.

    <h2> WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? </h2>
